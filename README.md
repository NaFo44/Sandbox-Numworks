# Sandbox-Numworks
A sandbox game created for the numworks calculator has external app.

# A BIG THANKS to booti386 for helping me during this project

## Place particules :
- Walls : OK (set the first point and the second point of the wall by clicking on the OK key)
- Sand : Back
- Flying particules xd : Toolbox / paste
- Water : Exe (I'm working on it, the water movement is weird but don't pay attention to it)

## Cursor :
- Up / Down / Left / Right
- plus and minus to change the size of the cursor

## Current issues :
- Sometimes crash when touching walls AND placing particules AND moving the cursor
- Particules density is not respected
